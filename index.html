                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Galactic/GalacticNuclei/Aarav Saini! I'm a 13
                    year old, and I'm aspiring to become a professional web
                    developer. I love creating websites and applications that
                    are visually appealing and user-friendly. I've had a knack
                    for coding since I was 9, in the covid lockdowns. Ever
                    since, I've enjoyed coding, making it a hobby and a passion.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    > <b>Stack</b><br />
                    I'm currently practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also
                    have experience with React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and
                    Discord.js. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and
                    improve my skills.<br /><br />
                    > <b>Contact</b><br />
                    I'm not gonna give you my mail, because I NEVER check it,
                    lol. But here's my Discord:
